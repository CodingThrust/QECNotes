  abstract = {Transitioning from quantum computation on physical qubits to quantum computation on encoded, logical qubits can improve the error rate of operations, and will be essential for realizing valuable quantum computational advantages. Using a neutral atom quantum processor with 256 qubits, each an individual Ytterbium atom, we demonstrate the entanglement of 24 logical qubits using the distance-two [[4,2,2]] code, simultaneously detecting errors and correcting for lost qubits. We also implement the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm with up to 28 logical qubits encoded in the [[4,1,2]] code, showing better-than-physical error rates. We demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computation in our approach, guided by the proposal of Gottesman (2016), by performing repeated loss correction for both structured and random circuits encoded in the [[4,2,2]] code. Finally, since distance-two codes can correct qubit loss, but not other errors, we show repeated loss and error correction using the distance-three [[9,1,3]] Bacon-Shor code. These results begin to clear a path for achieving scientific quantum advantage with a programmable neutral atom quantum processor.},

  abstract = {Finding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems is pivotal in both scientific and technological domains, within academic research and industrial applications. A considerable amount of effort has been invested in the development of accelerated methods that leverage sophisticated models and harness the power of advanced computational hardware. Despite the advancements, a critical challenge persists, the dual demand for both high efficiency and broad generality in solving problems. In this work, we propose a general method, Free-Energy Machine (FEM), based on the ideas of free-energy minimization in statistical physics, combined with automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization in machine learning. The algorithm is flexible, solving various combinatorial optimization problems using a unified framework, and is efficient, naturally utilizing massive parallel computational devices such as graph processing units (GPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We benchmark our algorithm on various problems including the maximum cut problems, balanced minimum cut problems, and maximum \$k\$-satisfiability problems, scaled to millions of variables, across both synthetic, real-world, and competition problem instances. The findings indicate that our algorithm not only exhibits exceptional speed but also surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for individual problems. This highlights that the interdisciplinary fusion of statistical physics and machine learning opens the door to delivering cutting-edge methodologies that will have broad implications across various scientific and industrial landscapes.},

  abstract = {We propose a new effective Monte Carlo (MC) procedure for direct calculation of the free energy in a single MC run. The partition function of the expanded ensemble is introduced including a sum of canonical partition functions with a set of temperatures and additive factors (modification). Random walk in the space of both particle coordinates and temperatures provides calculation of free energy in a wide range of T. The method was applied to a primitive model of electrolyte including the region of low temperatures. In similar way other variants of expanded ensembles are constructed (e.g., over the number of particles N or volume V). Its facilities in quantum statistics (path integral Monte Carlo) and some other applications are also discussed.},
